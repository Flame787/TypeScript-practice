- Project was created with CLI-command:

npx create-react-app react-ts --template typescript

- where react-ts is the name of the application.

- Once the app has been installed, position into it's root folder:  

cd react-ts

- Then, start the development server on http://localhost:3000/: 

npm start

index.tsx:

import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));

- Not working, because since React 18, 'ReactDOM.render' doesn't exist anymore in react-dom/client.
- We must use ReactDOM.createRoot(...) and then call .render(...) on that root object:

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(
  document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement
);
root.render(<App />);

- Or this would be even better, with Strictmode:

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement);
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);
